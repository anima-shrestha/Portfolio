        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Anima Shrestha, the creator of Viora Light. My journey into candle-making started with a passion for creating warmth and ambiance in everyday spaces. I wanted to craft something that not only illuminates a room but also brings comfort, relaxation, and a touch of elegance.

            At Viora Light, every candle is handcrafted with love and attention to detail. I use high-quality ingredients to ensure a clean burn and long-lasting fragrance, making each candle a special experience. My goal is to share this passion with others, offering beautifully designed candles that enhance your moments—whether it’s a quiet evening, a self-care ritual, or a thoughtful gift.
            
            Thank you for being part of this journey. Let Viora Light brighten your world, one flame at a time</p>
